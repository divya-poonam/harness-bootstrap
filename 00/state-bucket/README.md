This is the first step towards bootstrapping harness pipeline setup.

This module creates a state bucket which is used to store state of all the infrastructure created hereafter.
It could be manually created or automated via pipeline.
All the states will be created inside this s3 bucket.
This can be considered as first piece of infrastructure created.
